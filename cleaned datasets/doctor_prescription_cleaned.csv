PR005,PAT005,2015-01-05,DOC005,"chief complaint:  ,hip pain.,history of presenting illness:  ,the patient is a very pleasant 41-year-old white female that is known to me previously from our work at the pain management clinic, as well as from my residency training program, san francisco. we have worked collaboratively for many years at the pain management clinic and with her departure there, she has asked to establish with me for clinic pain management at my office.  she reports moderate to severe pain related to a complicated past medical history.  in essence, she was seen at a very young age at the clinic for bilateral knee and hip pain and diagnosed with bursitis at age 23.  she was given nonsteroidals at that time, which did help with this discomfort.  with time, however, this became inadequate and she was seen later in san francisco in her mid 30s by dr. v, an orthopedist who diagnosed retroverted hips at hospital.  she was referred for rehabilitation and strengthening.  most of this was focused on her si joints.  at that time, although she had complained of foot discomfort, she was not treated for it.  this was in 1993 after which she and her new husband moved to the boston area, where she lived from 1995-1996.  she was seen at the pain center by dr. r with similar complaints of hip and knee pain.  she was seen by rheumatologists there and diagnosed with osteoarthritis as well as osteophytosis of the back.  medications at that time were salicylate and ultram.,when she returned to portland in 1996, she was then working for dr. b.  she was referred to a podiatrist by her local doctor who found several fractured sesamoid bones in her both feet, but this was later found not to be the case.  subsequently, nuclear bone scans revealed osteoarthritis.  orthotics were provided.  she was given paxil and tramadol and subsequently developed an unfortunate side effect of grand mal seizure.  during this workup of her seizure, imaging studies revealed a pericardial fluid-filled cyst adhered to her ventricle.  she has been advised not to undergo any corrective or reparative surgery as well as to limit her activities since.  she currently does not have an established cardiologist having just changed insurance plans.  she is establishing care with dr. s, of rheumatology for her ongoing care.  up until today, her pain medications were being written by dr. y prior to establishing with dr. l.,pain management in town had been first provided by the office of dr. f. under his care, followup mris were done which showed ongoing degenerative disc disease, joint disease, and facet arthropathy in addition to previously described sacroiliitis.  a number of medications were attempted there, including fentanyl patches with flonase from 25 mcg titrated upwards to 50 mcg, but this caused oversedation.  she then transferred her care to ab cd, fnp under the direction of dr. k.  her care there was satisfactory, but because of her work schedule, the patient found this burdensome as well as the guidelines set forth in terms of monthly meetings and routine urine screens.  because of a previous commitment, she was unable to make one unscheduled request to their office in order to produce a random urine screen and was therefore discharged.,past medical history:  ,1.  attention deficit disorder.,2.  tmj arthropathy.,3.  migraines.,4.

tolerate the tube being removed with close monitoring by nursing at his extended care facility.  i did impress the fact that i believe he probably will have other events requiring airway support, which could include intubation, and if the intubation is prolonged a tracheostomy may be needed.  creation of a long-term tracheostoma may be beneficial whereas the patient would not need such a long tracheostomy tube, and i informed the patient there are other options other than the tube he has at the present time.  the patient still wished to have the tube removed and he is aware he may need to have it replaced or he may have trouble with the area healing or scarring or he could end up having an emergent airway situation with the tube gone, but wishes to have it removed, and i did remove it today.  dressing was applied and we will see him back next week to make sure everything is healing properly.","cardiovascular / pulmonary, thrombosed, hyperkalemia, thrombectomy, forearm loop graft,

the risks and benefits of the aforementioned procedure, patient was taken to the operating room and general endotracheal anesthesia was administered.  next the neck, chest and legs were prepped and draped in the standard surgical fashion.  we used a #10-blade scalpel to make a midline median sternotomy incision.  dissection was carried down to the left of the sternum using bovie electrocautery.  the sternum was opened with a sternal saw.  the chest retractor was positioned.  next, full-dose heparin was given.  the pericardium was opened.  pericardial stay sutures were positioned.  after obtaining adequate act, we prepared to place the patient on cardiopulmonary bypass.  a 2-0 double pursestring of ethibond suture was placed in the ascending aorta.  through this was passed an aortic cannula connected to the arterial side of the cardiopulmonary bypass machine.  next a 3-0 prolene pursestring was placed in the right atrial appendage.  through this was passed our venous cannula connected to the venous portion of the cardiopulmonary bypass machine.  a 4-0 u-stitch was placed in the right atrium.  a retrograde cardioplegia catheter was positioned at this site.  next, scissors were used to dissect out the right upper pulmonary vein.  a 4-0 prolene pursestring was placed in the right upper pulmonary vein.  next, a right-angle sump was placed at this position.  we then connected our retrograde cardioplegia catheter to the cardioplegia solution circuit.  bovie electrocautery was used to dissect the interface between the aorta and pulmonary artery.  the aorta was completely encircled.  next, an antegrade cardioplegia needle and associated sump were placed in the ascending aorta.  we then prepared to cross-clamp the aorta.  we went down on our flows and cross-clamped the aorta.  we backed up our flows.  we then gave antegrade and retrograde cold blood cardioplegia solution circuit so as to arrest the heart.  the patient had some aortic insufficiency so we elected, after initially arresting the heart, to open the aorta and transect it and then give direct ostial infusion of cardioplegia solution circuit.  next, after obtaining complete diastolic arrest of the heart, we turned our attention to exposing the aortic valve, and 4-0 tycron sutures were placed in the commissures.  in addition, a 2-0 prolene suture was placed in the aortic wall so as to bring the aortic wall and root up into view.  next, scissors were used to excise the diseased aortic valve leaflets.  care was taken to remove all the calcium from the aortic annulus.  we then sized up the aortic annulus which came out to be a **-mm stentless porcine toronto valve.  we prepared the valve.  next, we placed our proximal suture line of interrupted 4-0 tycron sutures for the annulus.  we started with our individual commissural stitches.  they were connected to our valve sewing ring.  next, we placed 5 interrupted 4-0 tycron sutures in a subannular fashion at each commissural position.  after doing so, we passed 1 end of the suture through the sewing portion of the toronto stentless porcine valve.  the valve was lowered into place and all of the sutures were tied.  next, we gave another round of cold blood antegrade and retrograde cardioplegia.  next, we sewed our distal suture line.  we began with the left coronary cusp of the valve.  we ran a 5-0 rb needle up both sides of the valve.  care was taken to avoid the left coronary ostia.  this procedure was repeated on the right cusp of the stentless porcine valve.  again, care was taken to avoid any injury to the coronary ostia.  lastly, we sewed our non-coronary cusp.  this was done without difficulty.  at this point we inspected our aortic valve.  there was good coaptation of the leaflets, and it was noted that both the left and the right coronary ostia were open.  we gave another round of cold blood antegrade and retrograde cardioplegia.  the antegrade portion was given in a direct ostial fashion once again.  we now turned our attention to closing the aorta.  a 4-0 prolene double row of suture was used to close the aorta in a running fashion.  just prior to closing, we de-aired the heart and gave a warm shot of antegrade and retrograde cardioplegia.  at this point, we removed our aortic cross-clamp.  the heart gradually regained its electromechanical activity.  we placed 2 atrial and 2 ventricular pacing wires.  we removed our aortic vent and oversewed that site with another 4-0 prolene on an sh needle.  we removed our retrograde cardioplegia catheter.  we oversewed that site with a 5-0 prolene.  by now, the heart was de-aired and resumed normal electromechanical activity.  we began to wean the patient from cardiopulmonary bypass.  we then removed our venous cannula and suture ligated that site with a #2 silk.  we then gave full-dose protamine.  after knowing that there was no evidence of a protamine reaction, we removed the aortic cannula.  we buttressed that site with a 4-0 prolene on an sh needle.  we placed a mediastinal chest tube and brought it out through the skin.  we also placed 2 blake drains, 1 in the left chest and 1 in the right chest, as

decortication and the patient understands the need for surgery and signed the preoperative informed consent.,operative procedure: , the patient was taken to the operative suite and placed in the supine position under general anesthesia per anesthesia department.  intraoperative bronchoscopy was performed by dr. y and evaluation of carina, left upper and lower lobes with segmental evidence of diffuse mucous, thick secretions which were thoroughly lavaged with sterile saline lavage.  samples were obtained from both the left and the right subbronchiole segments for gram stain cultures and asp evaluation.  the right bronchus lower, middle, and upper were also examined and subsegmental bronchiole areas were thoroughly examined with no evidence of masses, lesions, or suspicious extrinsic compressions on the bronchi.  at this point, all mucous secretions were thoroughly irrigated and aspirated until the airways were clear.  bronchoscope was then removed.  vital signs remained stable throughout this portion of the procedure.  the patient was re-intubated by anesthesia with a double lumen endotracheal tube.  at this point, the patient was repositioned in the left lateral decubitus position with protection of all pressure points and the table was extended in customary fashion.  at this point, the right chest was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  the chest tube was removed before prepping the patient and the prior thoracostomy site was cleansed thoroughly with betadine.  the first port was placed through this incision intrathoracically.  a bronchoscope was placed for inspection of the intrathoracic cavity.  pictures were taken.  there is extensive fibrinous exudate noted under parietal and visceral pleura, encompassing the lung surface, diaphragm, and the posterolateral aspect of the right thorax.  at this point, a second port site anteriorly was placed under direct visualization.  with the aid of the thoracoscopic view, a yankauer resection device was placed in the thorax and blunt decortication was performed and aspiration of reminder of the pleural fluid.  due to the gelatinous nature of the fibrinous exudate, there were areas of right upper lobe that adhered to the chest wall and the middle and lower lobes appeared entrapped.  due to the extensive nature of the disease, decision was made to open the chest in a formal right thoracotomy fashion.  incision was made.  the subcutaneous tissues were then electrocauterized down to the level of the latissimus dorsi, which was separated with electrocautery down to the anterior 6th rib space.  the chest cavity was entered with the right lung deflated per anesthesia at our request.  once the intrathoracic cavity was accessed, a thorough decortication was performed in meticulous

of pleura and lung.,anesthesia:,  general.,findings: , the patient has a complex history, which goes back about four months ago when she started having respiratory symptoms and one week ago she was admitted to another hospital with hemoptysis and on her evaluation there which included two cat scans of chest she was found to have marked consolidation of the left lung with a questionable lung abscess or cavity with hydropneumothorax.  there was also noted to be some mild infiltrates of the right lung.  the patient had a 30-year history of cigarette smoking.  a chest tube was placed at the other hospital, which produced some brownish fluid that had foul odor, actually what was thought to be a fecal-like odor.  then an abdominal ct scan was done, which did not suggest any communication of the bowel into the pleural cavity or any other significant abnormalities in the abdomen on the abdominal ct.  the patient was started on antibiotics and was then taken to the operating room, where there was to be a thoracoscopy performed.  the patient had a flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy that showed no endobronchial lesions, but there was bloody mucous in the left main stem bronchus and this was suctioned out.  this was suctioned out with the addition of the use of saline ***** in the bronchus.  following the bronchoscopy, a double lumen tube was placed, but it was not possible to secure the double lumen to the place so we did not proceed with the thoracoscopy on that day.,the patient was transferred for continued evaluation and treatment.  today, the double lumen tube was placed and there was some erythema of the mucosa noted in the airways in the bronchi and also remarkably bloody secretions were also noted.  these were suctioned, but it was enough to produce a temporary obstruction of the left mainstem bronchus.  eventually, the double lumen tube was secured and an attempt at a left thoracoscopy was performed after the chest tube was removed and digital dissection was carried out through that.  the chest tube tract, which was about in the sixth or seventh intercostal space, but it was not possible to dissect enough down to get a acceptable visualization through this tract.  a second incision for thoracoscopy was made about on the sixth intercostal space in the midaxillary line and again some digital dissection was carried out but it was not enough to be able to achieve an opening or space for satisfactory inspection of the pleural cavity.  therefore the chest was opened and remarkable findings included a very dense consolidation of the entire lung such that it was very hard and firm throughout.  remarkably, the surface of the lower lobe laterally was not completely covered with a fibrotic line, but it was more the line anterior and posterior and more of it over the left upper lobe.  there were many pockets of purulent material, which had a gray-white appearance to it.  there was quite a bit of whitish fibrotic fibrinous deposit on the parietal pleura of the lung especially the upper lobe.  the adhesions were taken down and they were quite bloody in some areas indicating that the process had been present for some time.  there seemed to be an abscess that was about 3 cm in dimension, all the lateral basilar segment of the lower lobe near the area where the chest tube was placed.  many cultures were taken from several areas.  the most remarkable finding was a large cavity, which was probably about 11 cm in dimension, containing grayish pus and also caseous-like material, it was thought to be perhaps necrotic lung tissue, perhaps a deposit related to tuberculosis in the cavity.,the apex of the lung was quite densely adhered to the parietal pleura there and the adhesions were quite thickened and firm.,procedure and technique:,  with the patient lying with the right side down on the operating table the left chest was prepped and draped in sterile manner.  the chest tube had been removed and initially a blunt dissection was carried out through the old chest tube tract, but then it was necessary to enlarge it slightly in order to get the thoracoport in place and this was done and as mentioned above we could not achieve the satisfactory visualization through this.  therefore, the next incision for thoracoport and thoracoscopy insertion through the port was over the sixth intercostal space and a little bit better visualization was achieved, but it was clear that we would be unable to complete the procedure by thoracoscopy.  therefore posterolateral thoracotomy incision was made, entering the pleural space and what is probably the sixth intercostal space.  quite a bit of blunt and sharp and electrocautery dissection was performed to take down adhesions to the set of the fibrinous deposit on the pleural cavity.  specimens for culture were taken and specimens for permanent histology were taken and a frozen section of one of the most quite dense.  suture ligatures of prolene were required.  when the cavity was encountered it was due to some compression and dissection of some of the fibrinous deposit in the upper lobe laterally and anterior and this became identified as a very thin layer in one area over this abscess and when it was opened it was quite large and we unroofed it completely and there was bleeding down in the depths of the cavity, which appeared to be from pulmonary veins and these were sutured with a ""tissue pledget"" of what was probably intercostal nozzle and endothoracic fascia with prolene sutures.,also as the upper lobe was retracted in caudal direction the tissue was quite dense and the superior branch of the pulmonary artery on the left side was torn and for hemostasis a 14-french foley catheter was passed into the area of the tear and the balloon was inflated, which helped establish hemostasis and suturing was carried out again with utilizing a small pledget what was probably intercostal muscle and endothoracic fascia and this was sutured in place and the foley catheter was removed.  the patch was sutured onto the pulmonary artery tear.  a similar maneuver was utilized on the pulmonary vein bleeding site down deep in the cavity.  also on the

biopsies were taken from multiple sites on the pleura and on the edge and on the lung.  then two #24 blake chest tubes were placed, one through a stab wound above the incision anteriorly and one below

intercostal nerve blocks at probably the fifth, sixth, and seventh intercostal nerves was carried out.  then the sixth rib had been broken and with retraction the fractured ends were resected and rongeur used to smooth out the end fragments of this rib.  metallic clip was passed through the rib to facilitate passage of an intracostal suture, but the bone was partially fractured inferiorly and it was very difficult to get the suture out through the inner cortical table, so that pericostal sutures were used with #1 vicryl.  the chest wall was closed with running #1 vicryl and then 2-0 vicryl subcutaneous and staples on the skin.  the chest tubes were connected to water-seal drainage with 40 cm of water negative pressure.  sterile dressings were applied.  the patient tolerated the

until the sternum was scored and divided with an oscillating saw.  a subtotal thymectomy was performed.  systemic heparinization was achieved and the pericardium was entered and fashioned until cradle.  a small portion of the anterior pericardium was procured and fixed in glutaraldehyde for patch closure of segment of the atrial septal defect during the procedure.  pursestrings were deployed on the ascending aorta on the right.  atrial appendage.  the aorta was then cannulated with an 8-french aorta cannula and the right atrium with an 18-french polystan right-angle cannula.  with an act greater than 400, greater pulmonary bypass was commenced with excellent cardiac decompression and the patent ductus arteriosus was ligated with a 2-0 silk tie.  systemic cooling was started and the head was packed  and iced and systemic steroids were administered.  during cooling, traction suture was placed in the apex of the left ventricle.  after 25 minutes of cooling, the aorta was cross-clamped and the heart arrested by administration of 30 cubic centimeter/kilogram of cold-blood cardioplegia delivered directly within the aortic root following the aorta cross-clamping.  following successful cardioplegic arrest, a period of low flow perfusion was started and a 10-french catheter was inserted into the right atrial appendage substituting the 18-french polystan venous cannula.  the heart was then rotated to the right side and the venous confluence was exposed.  it was incised and enlarged and a corresponding incision in the dorsal and posterior aspect of the left atrium was performed.  the two openings were then anastomosed in an end-to-side fashion with several interlocking sutures to avoid pursestring effect with a running 7-0 pds suture.  following completion of the anastomosis, the heart was returned into the chest and the patient's blood volume was drained into the reservoir.  a right atriotomy was then performed during the period of

deairing maneuvers were carried out and lining was administered and the right atriotomy was closed in two layers with a running 6-0 prolene sutures.  the venous cannula was reinserted.  cardiopulmonary bypass restarted and the aorta cross-clamp was released.  the patient returned to normal sinus rhythm spontaneously and started regaining satisfactory hemodynamics which, following a prolonged period of rewarming, allow for us to wean her from cardiopulmonary bypass successfully and moderate inotropic support and sinus rhythm.  modified ultrafiltration was carried out and two sets of atrial and ventricular pacing wires were placed as well as the peritoneal dialysis catheter and two 15-french blake drains.  venous decannulation was followed by aortic decannulation and administration of protamine sulfate.  all cannulation sites were oversewn with 6-0 prolene sutures and the anastomotic sites noticed to be hemostatic.  with good hemodynamics and hemostasis, the

despite medical therapy, she continued to have intermittent angina.  angiography demonstrated the severe lad as the culprit lesion.  this was treated as noted above with angioplasty alone as the stent could not be safely advanced.  she has residual lesions of 75% in the proximal right coronary and 60% proximal circumflex, and the other residual lad lesions as noted above.  she will be continued on her medical therapy.  at age 90, she is not a good candidate for aortic valve replacement and coronary bypass grafting.,procedure performed: , selective coronary angiography, coronary angioplasty.,procedure in detail:,  after informed consent was obtained, the patient was taken to the cath lab, placed on the table in the supine position.  the area of the right femoral artery was prepped and draped in a sterile fashion.  using the percutaneous technique, a 6-french sheath was placed in the right femoral artery under fluoroscopic guidance.  with the guidewire in place, a 5-french jl-4 catheter was used to selectively angiogram the left coronary system.  the catheter was removed.  the sheath flushed.  the 5-french 3drc catheter was then used to selectively angiogram the right coronary artery.  the cath removed, the sheath flushed.,it was decided that intervention was needed in the severe lesions in the lad, which appeared to be the culprit lesions for the non-st elevation-mi.  the patient was given a bolus of heparin and an act of approximately 50 seconds was obtained, we rebolused and the act was slightly lower.  we repeated the level and it was slightly higher.  we administered 500 more units of heparin and then proceeded with an act of approximately 270 seconds prior to the 500 units of heparin iv.  additionally, the patient had been given 300 mg of plavix orally during the procedure and integrilin iv bolus and then maintenance drip was started.,a 6-french cls 3.5 left coronary guide catheter was used to cannulate the left main and hew guidewire was positioned in the distal lad and another hew guidewire in the relatively large third diagonal.  an apex 2.5 x 15 mm balloon was positioned in the distal portion of the mid lad stenosis and inflated to 6 atmospheres for 15 seconds and then deflated.  angiography was then performed, demonstrated marked improvement in the stenosis and this image was used for sizing the last of the needed stent.  the balloon was pulled more proximally and then inflated again at 6 atmospheres for approximately 20 seconds, with the proximal end of the balloon positioned distal to the origin of the third diagonal so as to not compromise the ostium.  the balloon was inflated and removed, repeat angiography performed.  we attempted to advance a driver 2.5 x 24 mm bare metal stent, but i could not advance it beyond the proximal lad, where there was significant calcification.  the stent was removed.  attempts to advance the same 2.5 x 15 mm apex balloon that was previously used were unsuccessful.  it was removed, a new apex 2.5 x 15 mm balloon was then positioned in the proximal lad and inflated to 6 atmospheres for 15 seconds and then deflated and advanced slightly with the distal tip of the balloon proximal to the third diagonal ostium and it was inflated to 6 atmospheres for 15 seconds and then deflated and removed.  repeat angiography demonstrated no evidence of dissection.  one more attempt was made to advance the driver 2.5 x 24 mm bare metal stent, but again i could not advance it beyond the calcified plaque in the proximal lad and this was despite the presence of the buddy wire in the diagonal.  i felt that further attempts in this calcified vessel in a 90-year-old with severe aortic stenosis and severe aortic insufficiency would likely result in complications of dissection, so the stent was removed.  the guidewires and guide cath were removed.  the sheath flushed and sutured into position.  the patient moved to icu in stable condition with no chest discomfort at all.,contrast: , isovue-370, 120 ml.,fluoro time: , 9.4 minutes.,estimated blood loss: , 30 ml.,hemodynamics:,  aorta 185/54.,left ventriculography was not performed.  i did not

calcification in the walls.,the lad is a moderate-to-large vessel, giving rise to small diagonals and then a moderate-to-large third diagonal, and then a small fourth diagonal.  the lad has significant calcification proximally.  there is a 50% stenosis between the first and second diagonals that we treated with angioplasty alone in an attempt to be able to advance the stent.  this resulted in a 30% residual, mostly eccentric calcified plaque.  following this, there was a 50% stenosis in the lad just after the takeoff of the third diagonal.  this was not ballooned.  beyond this is an 80% stenosis prior to the fourth diagonal and then a 99% stenosis after the fourth diagonal.  these 2 lesions were dilated with 10% residual prior to the fourth diagonal and 25% residual distal to the fourth diagonal.  as noted above, this area was not stented because i could not safely advance the stent.  note, there was also a 50% stenosis at the origin of the moderate-to-large third diagonal that did not change with angioplasty.,the circumflex is a large, nondominant vessel consisting of a large obtuse marginal with multiple branches.  the proximal circumflex has an eccentric 60%

mildly elevated fontan pressures in the context of a widely patent fontan fenestration and intolerance of fontan fenestration occlusion.  the patient then followed conservatively since that time.  the patient is undergoing a repeat evaluation to assess his candidacy for a fontan fenestration occlusion, as well as consideration for a tricuspid valvuloplasty in attempt to relieve right ventricular hypertension and associated membranous ventricular aneurysm protruding into the left ventricular outflow tract.,procedure:,  after sedation and local xylocaine anesthesia, the patient was placed under general endotracheal anesthesia, the patient was prepped and draped.  cardiac catheterization was performed as outlined in the attached continuation sheets.  vascular entry was by percutaneous technique, and the patient was heparinized.  monitoring during the procedure included continuous surface ecg, continuous pulse oximetry, and cycled cuff blood pressures, in addition to intravascular pressures.,using a 7-french sheath, a 6-french wedge catheter was inserted in the right femoral vein and advanced from the inferior vena cava along the fontan conduit into the main left pulmonary artery, as well as the superior vena cava.  this catheter was then exchanged for a 5-french vs catheter of a distal wire.  apposition of the right pulmonary artery over, which the wedge catheter was advanced.  the wedge catheter could then be easily advanced across the fontan fenestration into the right atrium and guidewire manipulation allowed access across the atrial septal defect to the pulmonary veins, left atrium, and left ventricle.,using a 5-french sheath, a 5-french pigtail catheter was inserted into the right femoral artery and advanced retrograde to the descending aorta, ascending aorta, and left ventricle.  attempt was then made to cross the tricuspid valve from the right atrium and guidewire persisted to prolapse through the membranous ventricular septum into the left ventricle.  the catheter distal wire position was finally achieved across what appeared to be the posterior aspect of the tricuspid valve, both angiographically as well as equal guidance.  left ventricular pressure was found to be suprasystemic.  a balloon valvoplasty was performed using a ranger 4 x 2 cm balloon catheter with no waste at minimal inflation pressure.  echocardiogram, which showed no significant change in the appearance of a tricuspid valve and persistence of aneurysmal membranous ventricular septum.  further angioplasty was then performed first utilizing a 6 mm cutting balloon directed through 7-french flexor sheath positioned within the right atrium.  there was a disappearance of a mild waist prior to spontaneous tear of the balloon.  the balloon catheter was then removed in its entirety.,echocardiogram again demonstrated no change in the appearance of the tricuspid valve.  a final angioplasty was performed utilizing a 80 mm cutting balloon with the disappearance of a distinctive waste.  echocardiogram; however, demonstrated no change and intact appearing tricuspid valve and no decompression of the right ventricle.  further attempts to cross tricuspid valve were thus abandoned.  attention was then directed to a fontan fenestration.  a balloon occlusion then demonstrated minimal increase in fontan pressures from 12 mmhg to 15 mmhg.  with less than 10% fall in calculated cardiac index.  the angiogram in the inferior vena cava demonstrated a large fenestration measuring 6.6 mm in diameter with a length of 8 mm.  a 7-french flexor sheath was again advanced cross the fenestration.  a 10-mm amplatzer muscular ventricular septal defect occluder was loaded on delivery catheter and advanced through the sheath where the distal disk was allowed to be figured in the right atrium.  entire system was then brought into the fenestration and withdrawal of the sheath allowed reconfiguration of the proximal disk.  once the stable device configuration was confirmed, device was released from the delivery catheter.  hemodynamic assessment and the angiograms were then repeated.,flows were calculated by the fick technique using an assumed oxygen consumption and contents derived from radiometer hemoximeter saturations and hemoglobin capacity.,angiograms with injection in the right coronary artery, left coronary artery, superior vena cava, inferior vena cava, and right ventricle.,after angiography, two normal-appearing renal collecting systems were visualized.  the catheters and sheaths were removed and topical pressure applied for hemostasis.  the patient was returned to the recovery room in satisfactory condition.  there were no complications.,discussion: , oxygen consumption was assumed to be normal.  mixed venous saturation was low due to systemic arterial desaturation.  there was modest increased saturation of the branch pulmonary arteries due to the presumed aortopulmonary collateral flow.  the right pulmonary veins were fully saturated.  left pulmonary veins were not entered.  there was a fall in saturation within the left ventricle and descending aorta due to a right to left shunt across the fontan fenestration.  mean fontan pressures were 12 mmhg with a 1 mmhg fall in mean pressure into the distal left pulmonary artery.  right and left pulmonary capillary wedge pressures were similar to left atrial phasic pressure with an a-wave similar to the normal left ventricular end-diastolic pressure of 11 mmhg.  left ventricular systolic pressure was normal with at most 5 mmhg systolic gradient pressure pull-back to the ascending aorta.  phasic ascending and descending aortic pressures were similar and normal.  the calculated systemic flow was normal.  pulmonary flow was reduced to the qt-qs ratio of 0.7621.  pulmonary vascular resistance was normal at 1 wood units.,angiogram with injection in the right coronary artery demonstrated diminutive coronary with an extensive sinusoidal communication to the rudimentary right ventricle.  the left coronary angiogram showed a left dominant system with a brisk flow to the left anterior descending and left circumflex coronary arteries.  there was communication to the right-sided coronary sinusoidal communication to the rudimentary right ventricle.  angiogram with injection in the superior vena cava showed patent right bidirectional glenn shunt with mild narrowing of the proximal right pulmonary artery, as well as the central pulmonary artery, diameter of which was augmented by the glenn anastomosis and the fontan anastomosis.  there was symmetric contrast flow to both pulmonary arteries.  a large degree of contrast flowed retrograde into the fontan and shunting into the right atrium across the fenestration.  there is competitive flow to the upper lobes presumably due to aortopulmonary collateral flow.  the branch pulmonaries appeared mildly hypoplastic.  levo phase contrast returned into the heart, appeared unobstructed demonstrating good left ventricular contractility.  angiogram with injection in the fontan showed a widely patent anastomosis with the inferior vena cava.  majority of the contrast flowing across the fenestration into the right atrium with a positive flow to the branch pulmonary arteries.,following the device occlusion of fontan fenestration, the fontan and mean pressure increased to 15 mmhg with a 3 mmhg, a mean gradient in the distal left pulmonary artery and no gradient into the right pulmonary artery.  there was an increase in the systemic arterial pressures.  mixed venous saturation increased from the resting state as with increase in systemic arterial saturation to 95%.  the calculated systemic flow increased slightly from the resting state and pulmonary flow was similar with a qt-qs ratio of 0.921.  angiogram with injection in the inferior vena cava showed a stable device configuration with a good disk apposition to the anterior surface of the fontan with no protrusion into the fontan and no residual shunt and no obstruction to a fontan flow.  an ascending aortogram that showed a left aortic arch with trace aortic insufficiency and

to the cardiac catheterization suite in postabsorptive and nonsedated state.  the right groin was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  lidocaine 2% was used for infiltration anesthesia.  using modified seldinger technique, a 7-french sheath was introduced into the right common femoral artery and a 6-french sheath was introduced into the right common femoral vein.  through the arterial sheath, angiography of the right common femoral artery was obtained.  thereafter, 6-french pigtail catheter was advanced to the level of the distal aorta where angiography of the distal aorta and the bifurcation of the right and left common iliac arteries was obtained.  thereafter, a 4-french sheath was introduced into the left common femoral artery using modified seldinger technique.  thereafter, the pigtail catheter was advanced over an 0.035-inch j-wire into the left ventricle and lv-gram was performed in rao view and after pullback, an aortogram was performed in the lao view.  therefore, a 6-french jl4 and jr4 guiding catheters were used to engage the left and right coronary arteries respectively and multiple orthogonal views of the coronary arteries were obtained.,angiographic

than 90% stenosis.,3.  the circumflex coronary artery had a patent stent.,intervention: , after reviewing the angiographic images, we elected to proceed with intervention of the left anterior descending artery.  the 4-french sheath in the left common femoral artery was upsized to a 12-french impella sheath through which an amplatz wire and a 6-french multipurpose catheter were advanced into the left ventricle.  the amplatz wire was exchanged for an impella 0.018-inch stiff wire.  the multipurpose catheter was removed, and the impella was advanced into the left ventricle and a performance level of 8 was achieved with a cardiac output of 2 to 2.5 l/min.  thereafter, a 7-french jl4 guiding catheter was used to engage the left coronary artery and an asahi soft 0.014-inch wire was advanced into the left anterior descending artery and a second 0.014-inch asahi soft wire was advanced into the diagonal branch.  the diagonal branch was predilated with a 2.5 x 30-mm sprinter

neurology was consulted.  noncontrast ct of the head was negative.  neurology felt that the only necessary intervention at that time would be to increase her lamictal to 150 mg in the morning and 100 mg in the evening with gradual increase of the dosage until she was on 200 mg b.i.d.  regarding the hypoglycemia, the patient has diabetic gastroparesis and was being fed on j-tube intermittent feedings throughout the night at the rate of 120 an hour.  her insulin pump had a basal rate of roughly three at night during the feedings.  while in the hospital, the insulin pump rate was turned down to 1.5 and then subsequently decreased a few other times.  she seemed to tolerate the insulin pump rate well throughout her hospital course.  there were a few episodes of hypoglycemia as well as hyperglycemia, but the episode seem to be related to the patient's n.p.o. status and the changing rates of tube feedings throughout her hospital course.,at discharge, her endocrinologist was contacted.  it was decided to change her insulin pump rate to 3 units per hour from midnight till 6 a.m., from 0.8 units per hour from 6 a.m. until 8 a.m., and then at 0.2 units per hour from 8 a.m. until 6 p.m.  the insulin was to be novolog.  regarding the anemia, the gastroenterologists were consulted regarding her positive hemoccult stools.  a colonoscopy was performed, which found a mass at

galloway medtronic fuser band.,3.  posterior leaflet abscess resection.,anesthesia:  ,general endotracheal anesthesia,times:  ,aortic cross-clamp time was ** minutes.  cardiopulmonary bypass time total was ** minutes.,procedure in detail: , after obtaining informed consent from the patient, including a thorough explanation of the risks and benefits of the aforementioned procedure, the patient was taken to the operating room and general endotracheal anesthesia was administered.  next, the patient's chest and legs were prepped and draped in standard surgical fashion.  a #10-blade scalpel was used to make a midline median sternotomy incision.  dissection was carried down to the level of the sternum using bovie electrocautery.  the sternum was opened with a sternal saw, and full-dose heparinization was given.  next, the chest retractor was positioned.  the pericardium was opened with bovie electrocautery and pericardial stay sutures were positioned.  we then prepared to place the patient on cardiopulmonary bypass.  a 2-0 ethibond double pursestring was placed in the ascending aorta.  through this was passed our aortic cannula and connected to the arterial side of the cardiopulmonary bypass machine.  next, double cannulation with venous cannulas was instituted.  a 3-0 prolene pursestring was placed in the right atrial appendage.  through this was passed our sec cannula.  this was connected to the venous portion of the cardiopulmonary bypass machine in a y-shaped circuit.  next, a 3-0 prolene pursestring was placed in the lower border of the right atrium.  through this was passed our inferior vena cava cannula.  this was likewise connected to the y connection of our venous cannula portion.  we then used a 4-0 u-stitch in the right atrium for our retrograde cardioplegia catheter, which was inserted.  cardiopulmonary bypass was instituted.  metzenbaum scissors were used to dissect out the svc and ivc, which were subsequently encircled with umbilical tape.  sondergaard's groove was taken down.  next, an antegrade cardioplegia needle and associated sump were placed in the ascending aorta.  this was connected appropriately as was the retrograde cardioplegia catheter.  next, the aorta was cross-clamped, and antegrade and retrograde cardioplegia was infused so as to arrest the heart in diastole.  next a #15-blade scalpel was used to open the left atrium.  the left atrium was decompressed with pump sucker.  next, our self-retaining retractor was positioned so as to bring the mitral valve up into view.  of note was the fact that the mitral valve p2 segment of the posterior leaflet had an abscess associated with it.  the borders of the p2 segment abscess were defined by using a right angle to define the chordae which were encircled with a 4-0 silk.  after doing so, the p2 segment of the posterior leaflet was excised with a #11-blade scalpel.  given the laxity of the posterior leaflet, it was decided to reconstruct it with a 2-0 ethibond pledgeted suture.  this was done so as to reconstruct the posterior annular portion.  prior to doing so, care was taken to remove any debris and abscess-type material.  the pledgeted stitch was lowered into place and tied.  next, the more anterior portion of the p2 segment was reconstructed by running a 4-0 prolene stitch so as to reconstruct it.  this was done without difficulty.  the apposition of the anterior and posterior leaflet was confirmed by infusing solution into the left ventricle.  there was noted to be a small amount of central regurgitation.  it was felt that this would be corrected with our annuloplasty portion of the procedure.  next, 2-0 non-pledgeted ethibond sutures were placed in the posterior portion of the annulus from trigone to trigone in interrupted fashion.  care was taken to go from trigone to trigone.  prior to placing these sutures, the annulus was sized and noted to be a *** size for the cosgrove-galloway suture band ring from medtronic.  after, as mentioned, we placed our interrupted sutures in the annulus, and they were passed through the cg suture band.  the suture band was lowered into position and tied in place.  we then tested our repair and noted that there was very mild regurgitation.  we subsequently removed our self-retaining retractor.  we closed our left atriotomy using 4-0 prolene in a running fashion.  this was done without difficulty.  we de-aired the heart.  we then gave another round of antegrade and retrograde cardioplegia in warm fashion.  the aortic cross-clamp was removed, and the heart gradually resumed electromechanical activity.  we then removed our retrograde cardioplegia catheter from the coronary sinus and buttressed this site with a 5-0 prolene.  we placed 2 ventricular and 2 atrial pacing leads which were brought out through the skin.  the patient was gradually weaned off cardiopulmonary bypass and our venous cannulas were removed.  we then gave full-dose protamine; and after noting that there was no evidence of a protamine reaction, we removed our aortic cannula.  this site was buttressed with a 4-0 prolene on an sh needle.  the patient tolerated the procedure well.  we placed a mediastinal #32-french chest tube as well as a right chest blake drain.  the mediastinum was inspected for any signs of bleeding.  there were none.  we closed the sternum with #7 sternal wires in interrupted figure-of-eight fashion.  the fascia was closed with a #1 vicryl followed by a 2-0 vicryl, followed by 3-0 vicryl in a running subcuticular fashion.  the instrument and sponge count was correct at the end of the case.  the patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the intensive care unit in good condition.","cardiovascular / pulmonary, hypokalemia,

used to perform confirmation of adequate placement of the double-lumen tube.  following this, the decision was made to proceed with the surgery.  the patient was rolled into the right lateral decubitus position with the left side up.  all pressure points were padded.  the patient had a sterile duraprep preparation to the left chest.  a sterile drape around that was applied.  also, the patient had marcaine infused into the incision area.  following this, the patient had a posterolateral thoracotomy incision, which was a muscle-sparing incision with a posterior approach just over the ausculatory triangle.  the incision was approximately 10 cm in size.  this was created with a 10-blade scalpel.  bovie electrocautery was used to dissect the subcutaneous tissues.  the auscultatory triangle was opened.  the posterior aspect of the latissimus muscle was divided from the adjacent tissue and retracted anteriorly.  the muscle was not divided.  after the latissimus muscle was retracted anteriorly, the ribs were counted, and the sixth rib was identified.  the superior surface of the sixth rib was incised with bovie electrocautery and the sixth rib was divided with rib shears.  following this, the patient had the entire intercostal muscle separated from the superior aspect of the sixth rib on the left as far as the bovie would reach.  the left lung was allowed to collapse and meticulous inspection of the left lung identified the lesions, which were taken out with stapled wedge resections via a ta30 green load stapler for all of the wedges.  the patient tolerated the procedure well without any complications.  the largest lesion was the left upper lobe apex lesion, which was possibly multiple lesions, which was taken in one large wedge segment, and this was also adjacent to another area of the wedges.  the patient had multiple pleural abnormalities, which were identified on the surface of the lung.  these were small white spotty looking lesions and were not confirmed to be tumor implants, but were suspicious to be multiple areas of tumor.  based on this, the wedges of the tumors that were easily palpable were excised with complete excision of all palpable lesions.  following this, the patient had a 32-french chest tube placed in the anteroapical position.  a 19-french blake was placed in the posterior apical position.  the patient had

from hospital with a new diagnosis of high-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia based on confirmation by flow cytometry of peripheral blood lymphoblasts that afternoon.  history related to this illness probably dates back to october of 2006 when he had onset of swelling and discomfort in the left testicle with what he described as a residual ""lump"" posteriorly.  the left testicle has continued to be painful off and on since.  in early november, he developed pain in the posterior part of his upper right leg, which he initially thought was related to skateboarding and muscle strain.  physical therapy was prescribed and the discomfort temporarily improved.  in december, he noted onset of increasing fatigue.  he used to work out regularly, lifting lifts, doing abdominal exercises, and playing basketball and found he did not have energy to pursue these activities.  he has lost 10 pounds since december and feels his appetite has decreased.  night sweats and cough began in december, for which he was treated with a course of augmentin.  however, both of these problems have continued.  he also began taking accutane for persistent acne in december (this agent was stopped on 02/19/2007).  despite increasing fatigue and lethargy, he continues his studies at university of denver, has a biology major (he aspires to be an ophthalmologist).,the morning of 02/19/2007, he awakened with severe right inguinal and right lower quadrant pain.  he was seen in emergency room where it was noted that he had an elevated wbc of 18,000.  ct scan of the abdomen was obtained to rule out possible appendicitis and on that ct, a large clot in the inferior vena cava extending to the right iliac and femoral veins was found.  he promptly underwent appropriate treatment in interventional radiology with the above-noted angioplasty and placement of a vena caval filter followed by mechanical and pharmacologic thrombolysis.  repeat ultrasound there on 02/20/2007 showed no evidence of deep venous thrombosis (dvt).  continuous intravenous unfractionated heparin infusion was continued.  because there was no obvious cause of this extensive thrombosis, occult malignancy was suspected.  appropriate blood studies were obtained and he underwent a pet/ct scan as part of his diagnostic evaluation.  this study showed moderately increased diffuse bone marrow metabolic activity.  because the wbc continued to rise and showed a preponderance of lymphocytes, the smear was reviewed by pathologist, sheryl asplund, m.d., and flow cytometry was performed on the peripheral blood.

april 4, 2007, was given general anesthesia and was endotracheally intubated without incident.  although, he had markedly difficult airway, the patient had fiberoptic bronchoscopy performed all the way down to the level of the subsegmental bronchi.  no abnormalities were noted in the entire tracheobronchial tree, and based on this, the decision was made to proceed with the surgery.  the patient was kept in the supine position, and the single-lumen endotracheal tube was removed and a double-lumen tube was placed.  following this, the patient was placed into the left lateral decubitus position with the right side up and all pressure points were padded.  sterile duraprep preparation on the right chest was placed.  a sterile drape around that was also placed.  the table was flexed to open up the intercostal spaces.  a second bronchoscopy was performed to confirm placement of the double-lumen endotracheal tube.  marcaine was infused into all incision areas prior to making an incision.  the

crease and the midclavicular line in the anterior sixth intercostal space, and the third incision was a utility port, which was a 4 cm long incision, which was approximately one rib space below the superior pulmonary vein.  all of these incisions were eventually created during the procedure.  the initial incision was the camera port through which, under direct visualization, an additional small 5-mm port was created just inferior to the anterior port.  these two ports were used to identify the chest wall lesions, which were initially thought to be metastatic lesions.  multiple biopsies of the chest wall lesions were taken, and the decision was made to also insert the auscultatory incision port.  through these three incisions, the initial working of the diagnostic portion of the chest wall lesion was performed.  multiple biopsies were taken of the entire chest wall offers and specimens came back as negative.  the right middle lobe was noted to be adherent to the anterior chest wall.  this area was taken down and the entire pleural surface along this area was taken down and sent for frozen pathologic analysis.  this also returned as negative with only fibrotic tissue and a few lymphocytes within the fibrotic tissue, but no tumor cells.  based on this, the decision was made to not proceed with chest wall resection and continue with right middle lobectomy.  following this, the anterior port was increased in size and the utility port was made and meticulous dissection from an anterior to posterior direction was performed.  the middle lobe branch of the right superior pulmonary vein was initially dissected and stapled with vascular load 45-mm endogia stapler.  following division of the right superior pulmonary vein, the right middle lobe bronchus was easily identified.  initially, this was thought to be the main right middle lobe bronchus, but in fact it was the medial branch of the right middle lobe bronchus.  this was encircled and divided with a blue load stapler with a 45-mm endogia.  following division of this, the pulmonary artery was easily identified.  two branches of the pulmonary artery were noted to be going into the right middle lobe.  these were individually divided with a vascular load after encircling with a right angle clamp.  the vascular staple load completely divided these arterial branches successfully from the main pulmonary artery trunk, and following this, an additional branch of the bronchus was noted to be going to the right middle lobe.  a fiberoptic bronchoscopy was performed intraoperatively and confirmed that this was in fact the lateral branch of the right middle lobe bronchus.  this was divided with a blue load stapler 45 mm endogia.  following division of this, the minor and major fissures were completed along the edges of the right middle lobe separating the right upper lobe from the right middle lobe as well as the right middle lobe from the right lower lobe.  following complete division of the fissure, the lobe was put into an endogia bag and taken out through the utility port.  following removal of the right middle lobe, a meticulous lymph node dissection sampling was performed excising the lymph node package in the 4r area as well as the 7 lymph node package.  node station 8 or 9 nodes were easily identified, therefore none were taken.  the patient was allowed to ventilate under water on the right lung with no obvious air leaking noted.  a 19-french blake was placed into the posterior apical position and a 32-french chest tube was placed in the anteroapical position.  following this, the patient's lung was allowed to reexpand fully, and the patient was checked for air leaking once again.  following this, all the ports were closed with 2-0 vicryl suture used for the deeper tissue, and 3-0 vicryl suture was used to reapproximate the subcutaneous tissue and 4-0 monocryl suture was used to close the skin in a running subcuticular fashion.  the patient tolerated the procedure well, was extubated in the operating room and taken to the recovery room in stable condition.","cardiovascular / pulmonary, heart catheterization, ventriculography, coronary angiography,

history of hypertension, severe tricuspid regurgitation with mild pulmonary hypertension and mild aortic stenosis admitted after a fall with left hip fracture and she will require surgery.  telemetry now reviewed, shows predominantly normal sinus rhythm with frequent apcs _____ earlier yesterday evening showed burst of multifocal atrial tachycardia and i suspect that was exacerbated by prior hypokalemia, which has been corrected.  there has been no atrial fibrillation documented.  i do not feel these troponins are significant given the stress or fall in prior multifocal atrial tachycardia with increased rate especially in the absence of chest pain or shortness of breath.  she actually describes feeling good exercise capacity prior to this fall.  given favorable risk to benefit ratio for needed left hip surgery, i feel she may proceed with needed left hip surgery from a cardiac standpoint with continued verapamil, which has been started, which should help control the multifocal atrial tachycardia, which she had and would watch for heart rate with that.  continued optimization of electrolytes.  the patient cannot take beta-blockers as previously toprol reportedly caused shortness of breath, although, there was some report that it caused bradycardia so we would watch her heart rate on the verapamil.  the patient is aware of the cardiac risks, certainly it is moderate, and wishes to proceed with needed surgery.  i do not feel any further cardiac evaluation is needed at this time and the patient may followup with dr. x after discharge.  regarding her mild thrombocytopenia, i would defer that to hospitalist and continue proton pump inhibitors for history of gastroesophageal reflux disease, management of left hip fracture as per orthopedist.","cardiovascular / pulmonary, chest pain, ekg, sinus, st depression, mci, gated spect, nuclear myocardial perfusion scan, ejection fraction, myocardial perfusion, perfusion scan, heart

the patient was sedated with the above stated medication and the patient was continuously monitored on pulse oximetry, noninvasive blood pressure, and ekg monitoring.  prior to starting the procedure, the patient was noted to have a baseline oxygen saturation of 86% on room air.  subsequently, she was given a bronchodilator treatment with atrovent and albuterol and subsequent saturation increased to approximately 90% to 91% on room air.,the patient was placed on a supplemental oxygen as the patient was sedated with above-stated medication.  as this occurred, the bronchoscope was inserted into the right naris with good visualization of the nasopharynx and oropharynx.  the cords were noted to oppose bilaterally on phonation.  there was some slight mucosal irregularity noted on the vocal cord on the left side.  additional topical lidocaine was instilled on the vocal cords, at which point the bronchoscope was introduced into the trachea, which was midline in nature.  the bronchoscope was then advanced to the distal trachea and additional lidocaine was instilled.  at this time, the bronchoscope was further advanced through the main stem and additional lidocaine was instilled.  bronchoscope was then further advanced into the right upper lobe, which revealed no evidence of any endobronchial lesion.  the mucosa was diffusely friable throughout.  bronchoscope was then slowly withdrawn into the right main stem and additional lidocaine was instilled.  at this point, the bronchoscope was then advanced to the right bronchus intermedius.  at this time, it was noted that there was severe mucosal irregularities of nodular in appearance significantly narrowing the right lower lobe and right middle lobe opening.  the mucosal area throughout this region was severely friable.  additional lidocaine was instilled as well as topical epinephrine.  at this time, bronchoscope was maintained in this region and endobronchial biopsies were performed.  at the initial attempt of inserting biopsy forceps, some resistance was noted within the proximal channel at this time making advancement of the biopsy forceps out of the proximal channel impossible.  so the biopsy forceps was withdrawn and the bronchoscope was completely withdrawn and new bronchoscope was then utilized.  at this time, bronchoscope was then reinserted into the right naris and subsequently advanced to the vocal cords into the right bronchus intermedius without difficulty.  at this time, the biopsy forceps were easily passed and visualized in the right bronchus intermedius.  at this time, multiple mucosal biopsies were performed with some mild oozing noted.  several aliquots of normal saline lavage followed.  after completion of multiple biopsies there was good hemostasis.  cytology flushing was also performed in this region and subsequently several aliquots of additional normal saline lavage was followed.  bronchoscope was unable to be passed distally to the base of the segment of the right lower lobe or distal to the further visualized endobronchial anatomy of the right middle lobe subsegments.  the bronchoscope was then withdrawn to the distal trachea.,at this time, bronchoscope was then advanced to the left main stem.  additional lidocaine was instilled.  the bronchoscope was advanced to the left upper and lower lobe subsegments.  there was no endobronchial lesion visualized.  there is mild diffuse erythema and fibromucosa was noted throughout.  no endobronchial lesion was visualized in the left bronchial system.  the bronchoscope was then subsequently further withdrawn to the distal trachea and readvanced into the right bronchial system.  at this time, bronchoscope was readvanced into the right bronchus intermedius and additional aliquots of normal saline lavage until cleared.  there is no gross bleeding evidenced at this time or diffuse mucosal erythema and edema present throughout.  the bronchoscope was subsequently withdrawn and the patient was sent to recovery room.  during the bronchoscopy, the patient noted ________ have desaturation and required increasing fio2 with subsequent increased saturation to 93% to 94%.  the patient remained at this level of saturation or greater throughout the remaining of the procedure.,the patient postprocedure relates having some intermittent hemoptysis prior to the procedure as well as moderate exertional dyspnea.  this was confirmed by her daughter and mother who were also present at the bedside postprocedure.  the patient did receive a nebulizer bronchodilator treatment immediately prebronchoscopy and postprocedure as well.  the patient also admitted to continued smoking in spite of all of the above.  the patient was extensively counseled regarding the continued smoking especially with her present symptoms.  she was advised regarding smoking cessation.  the patient was also placed on a prescription of prednisone 2 mg tablets starting at 40 mg a day decreasing every three days to continue to wean off.  the patient was also administered solu-medrol 60 mg iv x1 in recovery room.  there was no significant bronchospastic component noted, although because of the severity of the mucosal edema, erythema, and her complaints, short course of steroids will be instituted.  the patient was also advised to refrain from using any aspirin or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medication because of her hemoptysis.  at this time, the patient was also advised that if hemoptysis were to continue or worsen or develop progressive dyspnea, to either contact myself, , or return to

to palpate.  a repeat ultrasound was performed which demonstrated a high-grade stenosis involving the distal upper arm cephalic vein just distal to the brachial anastomosis.  the patient presents today for a left arm fistulogram with angioplasty.  the risks, benefits, and alternatives of the procedure were discussed with the patient and understands and in agreement to proceed.,procedure details:  ,the patient was brought to the angio suite and laid supine on the table.  after sedation was administered, the left arm was then prepped and draped in a standard surgical fashion.  continuous pulse oximetry and cardiac monitoring were performed throughout the procedure.  the patient was given 1 g of iv ancef prior to incision.,the left brachiocephalic fistula was visualized with bevel ultrasound.  the cephalic vein in the proximal upper arm region appeared to be of adequate caliber.  there was an area of stenosis at the proximal cephalic vein just distal to the brachial artery anastomosis.  the cephalic vein in the proximal forearm region was easily compressible.  the skin overlying the vessel was injected with 1% lidocaine solution.  a small incision was made with the #11 blade.  the cephalic vein then was cannulated with a 5 french micropuncture introducer sheath.  the sheath was advanced over the wire.  a fistulogram was performed which demonstrated a high-grade stenosis just distal to the brachial artery anastomosis.  the introducer sheath was then exchanged for a 5 french sheath over a 0.025 guide wire.  the sheath was aspirated and flushed with heparinized saline solution.  a 0.025 glidewire was then obtained and advanced, placed over the sheath and across the area of stenosis into the brachial artery.  a 5 french short kumpe catheter was used to guide the wire into the distal brachial and radial artery.  after crossing the area of stenosis, a 5 x 20 mm standard angioplasty balloon was obtained and prepped from the back table.  this was placed over the glidewire into the area of stenosis and inflated to 14 mmhg pressure and then deflated.  the balloon was then removed over the wire and repeat fistulogram was performed which demonstrated significant improvement.  however, there is still a remainder of residual stenosis.  the 5-mm balloon was placed over the wire again and a repeat angioplasty was performed.  the balloon was then removed over the wire and a repeat angiogram was performed which demonstrated again an area of stenosis right at the anastomosis.  the glidewire was removed and a 0.014 guide wire was then obtained and placed through the sheath and across the brachial anastomosis and into the radial artery.  a 4 x 20 mm cutting balloon was obtained and prepped on the back table.  the 5 french sheath was then exchanged for a 6 french sheath.  the balloon was then placed over the 0.014 guide wire into the area of stenosis and then inflated to normal pressures at 8 mmhg.  the balloon was then deflated and removed over the wire.  a 5 mm x 20 mm balloon was obtained and prepped and placed over the wire into the area of stenosis and inflated to pressures of 14 mmhg.  a repeat fistulogram was performed after the removal of the balloon which demonstrated excellent results with no significant residual stenosis.  the patient actually had a nice palpable thrill at this point.  the fistulogram of the distal cephalic vein at the subclavian anastomosis was performed which demonstrated a mild area of stenosis.  the sheath was removed and blood pressure was held over the puncture site for approximately 10 minutes.,after hemostasis was achieved, the cephalic vein again was visualized with bevel ultrasound.  the proximal cephalic vein was then cannulated after injecting the skin overlying the vessel with a 1% lidocaine solution.  a 5 french micropuncture introducer sheath was then placed over the wire into the proximal cephalic vein.  a repeat fistulogram was performed which demonstrated an area of stenosis within the distal cephalic vein just prior to the subclavian vein confluence.  the 5 french introducer sheath was then exchanged for a 5 french sheath.  the 5 mm x 20 mm balloon was placed over a 0.035 glidewire across the area of stenosis.  the balloon was inflated to 14 mmhg.  the balloon was then deflated and a repeat fistulogram was performed through the sheath which demonstrated good results.  the sheath was then removed and blood pressure was held over the puncture site for approximately 10 minutes.  after adequate hemostasis was achieved, the area was cleansed in 2x2 and tegaderm was applied.  the patient tolerated the procedure without any complications.  i was present for the entire case.  the sponge, instrument, and needle counts are correct at

epidural anesthesia placed.  in addition, he had a dual-lumen endotracheal tube placed.  the patient was placed in the supine position to begin the procedure.  his abdomen and chest were prepped and draped in the standard surgical fashion.  after applying sterile dressings, a #10-blade scalpel was used to make an upper midline incision from the level of the xiphoid to just below the umbilicus.  dissection was carried down through the linea using bovie electrocautery.  the abdomen was opened.  next, a balfour retractor was positioned as well as a mechanical retractor.  next, our attention was turned to freeing up the stomach.  in an attempt to do so, we identified the right gastroepiploic artery and arcade.  we incised the omentum and retracted it off the stomach and gastroepiploic arcade.  the omentum was divided using suture ligature with 2-0 silk.  we did this along the greater curvature and then moved to the lesser curvature where the short gastric arteries were taken down with ligation using 2-0 silk.  next, we turned our attention to performing a kocher maneuver.  this was done and the stomach was freed up.  we took down the falciform ligament as well as the caudate attachment to the diaphragm.  we enlarged the diaphragmatic hiatus so as to be able to place approximately 3 fingers into the chest.  we also did a portion of the esophageal dissection from the abdomen into the chest area.  the esophagus and the esophageal hiatus were identified in the abdomen.  we next turned our attention to the left gastric artery.  the left gastric artery was identified at the base of the stomach.  we first took the left gastric vein by ligating and dividing it using 0 silk ties.  the left gastric artery was next taken using suture ligature with silk ties followed by 2-0 stick tie reinforcement.  at this point the stomach was freely mobile.  we then turned our attention to performing our jejunostomy feeding tube.  a 2-0 vicryl pursestring was placed in the jejunum approximately 20 cm distal to the ligament of treitz.  we then used bovie electrocautery to open the jejunum at this site.  we placed a 16-french red rubber catheter through this site.  we tied down in place.  we then used 3-0 silk sutures to perform a witzel.  next, the loop of jejunum was tacked up to the abdominal wall using 2-0 silk ties.  after doing so and pulling the feeding jejunostomy out through the skin and securing it appropriately, we turned our attention to closing the abdomen.  this was done with #1 prolene.  we put in a 2nd layer of 2-0 vicryl.  the skin was closed with 4-0 monocryl.,next, we turned our attention to performing the thoracic portion of the procedure.  the patient was placed in the left lateral decubitus position.  the right chest was prepped and draped appropriately.  we then used a #10 blade scalpel to make an incision in a posterolateral, non-muscle-sparing fashion.  dissection was carried down to the level of the ribs with bovie electrocautery.  next, the ribs were counted and the 5th interspace was entered.  the lung was deflated.  we placed standard chest retractors.  next, we incised the peritoneum over the esophagus.  we dissected the esophagus to just above the azygos vein.  the azygos vein, in fact, was taken with 0 silk ligatures and reinforced with 2-0 stick ties.  as mentioned, we dissected the esophagus both proximally and distally down to the level of the hiatus.  after doing this, we backed our ng tube out to above the level where we planned to perform our pursestring.  we used an automatic pursestring and applied.  we then transected the proximal portion of the stomach with metzenbaum scissors.  we secured our pursestring and then placed a 28 anvil in the divided proximal portion of the esophagus.  the pursestring was then tied down without difficulty.  next, we tabularized our stomach using a #80 gia stapler.  after doing so, we chose a portion of the stomach more distally and opened it using bovie electrocautery.  we placed our eea stapler through it and then punched out through the gastric wall.  we connected our anvil to the eea stapler.  this was then secured appropriately.  we checked to make sure that there was appropriate muscle apposition.  we then fired the stapler.  we obtained 2 complete rings, 1 of the esophagus and 1 of the stomach, which were sent for pathology.  we also sent the gastroesophageal specimen for pathology.  of note was the fact that the frozen section showed no evidence of tumor and in the proximal distal margins.  we then turned our attention to closing the gastrostomy opening.  this was closed with 2-0 vicryl in a running fashion.  we then buttressed this with serosal 3-0 vicryl interrupted sutures.  we returned the newly constructed gastroesophageal anastomosis into the chest and covered it by covering the pleura over it.  next, we placed two #28-french chest tubes, 1 anteriorly and 1 posteriorly, taking care not to place it near the anastomosis.  we then closed the chest with #2 vicryl in an interrupted figure-of-eight fashion.  the lung was brought up.  we closed the muscle layers with #0 vicryl followed by #0 vicryl; then we closed the subcutaneous layer with 2-0 vicryl and the skin with 4-0 monocryl.  sterile dressing was applied.  the instrument and sponge count was correct at the end of the case.  the patient tolerated the procedure well and was extubated in the operating room and transferred to the icu in good condition.","cardiovascular / pulmonary, chest pain, serial troponins, premature coronary artery disease,

PR249,PAT249,2015-02-19,D0C046,"history:,  the patient is a 10-1/2-year-old born with asplenia syndrome with a complex cyanotic congenital heart disease characterized by dextrocardia bilateral superior vena cava, complete atrioventricular septal defect, a total anomalous pulmonary venous return to the right-sided atrium, and double-outlet to the right ventricle with malposed great vessels, the aorta being anterior with a severe pulmonary stenosis.  he had undergone staged repair beginning on 04/21/1997 with a right modified blalock-taussig shunt followed on 09/02/1999 with a bilateral bidirectional glenn shunt, and left pulmonary artery to main pulmonary artery pericardial patch augmentation.  these procedures were performed at medical college hospital.  family states that they moved to the united states.  evaluation at the children's hospital earlier this year demonstrated complete occlusion of the right bidirectional glenn shunt as well as occlusion of the proximal right pulmonary artery.  he was also found to have elevated glenn pressures at 22 mmhg, transpulmonary gradient axis of 14 mmhg.  the qp:qs ratio of 0.6:1.  a large decompressing venous collateral was also appreciated.  the patient was brought back to cardiac catheterization in an attempt to reconstitute the right caval pulmonary anastomosis and to occlude the venous collateral vessel.,description of procedure: , after sedation and local xylocaine anesthesia, the patient was prepped and draped.  cardiac catheterization was performed as outlined in the attached continuation sheets.  vascular entry was by percutaneous technique, and the patient was heparinized.  monitoring during the procedure included continuous surface ecg, continuous pulse oximetry, and cycled cuff blood pressures, in addition to intravascular pressures.,using a 6-french sheath, a 6-french wedge catheter was inserted in the right femoral vein and advanced from the inferior vena cava into the right-sided atrium pulmonary veins and the right ventricle.,using a 6-french sheath, a 5-french pigtail catheter was inserted into the right femoral artery and advanced retrograde to the descending aorta and ascending aorta.  a separate port of arterial access was obtained in the left femoral artery utilizing a 5-french sheath.,percutaneous access into the right jugular vein was attempted, but unsuccessful.  ultrasound on the right neck demonstrated a complete thrombosis of the right internal jugular vein.  using percutaneous technique and a 5-french sheath, 5-french wedge catheter was inserted into the left internal jugular vein and advanced along the left superior vena cava across the left caval-pulmonary anastomosis into the main pulmonary artery and left pulmonary artery with aid of guidewire.  this catheter then also advanced into the bridging innominate vein.  the catheter was then exchanged over wire for a 4-french bernstein catheter, which was advanced to the blind end of the right superior vena cava.  a balloon wedge angiogram of the right lower pulmonary vein demonstrated back filling of a small right lower pulmonary artery.  there was no vascular continuity to the stump of the right glenn.  the jugular venous catheter and sheaths were exchanged over a wire for a 6-french flexor sheath, which was advanced to the proximal right superior vena cava.  the bernstein catheter was then reintroduced using a terumo guidewire.  probing of the superior vena cava facilitated access into the right lower pulmonary artery.  the angiogram in the right pulmonary artery showed a diminutive right lower pulmonary artery and severe long segment proximal stenosis.  the distal pulmonary measured approximately 5.5 to 60 mm in diameter with a long segment stenosis measuring approximately 31 mm in length.  the length of the obstruction was balloon dilated using ultra-thin sd 4 x 2 cm balloon catheter with complete disappearance of the waist.  this facilitated advancement of a flexor sheath into the proximal portion of the stenosis.  a pg 2960 bpx genesis stent premounted on a 6 mm optiprobe.  a balloon catheter was advanced across the area of narrowing and inflated with a near-complete disappearance of proximal waist.  angiogram demonstrated a good stent apposition to the caval wall.  further angioplasty was then performed utilizing an ultra-thin sds 8 x 3 cm balloon catheter inflated to 19 atmospheres pressure with complete disappearance of a distinct proximal waist.  angiogram demonstrated wide patency of reconstituted right caval pulmonary anastomosis though there was no flow seen to the right upper pulmonary artery.  the balloon wedge angiograms were then obtained in the right upper pulmonary veins suggesting the presence of right upper pulmonary artery and not contiguous with the right lower pulmonary artery.  bernstein catheter was advanced into the main pulmonary artery where a wire probing of the stump of the proximal right pulmonary artery facilitated access to the right upper pulmonary artery.  angiogram demonstrated severe long segment stenosis of the proximal right pulmonary artery.  angioplasty of the right pulmonary was then performed using the optiprobe 6-mm balloon catheter inflated to 16 atmospheres pressure with disappearance of a distinct waist.  repeat angiogram showed improvement in caliber of right upper pulmonary artery with filling defect of the proximal right pulmonary artery.  the proximal right pulmonary artery was then dilated and stent implanted using a pg 2980 bpx genesis stent premounted on 8-mm optiprobe balloon catheter and implanted with complete disappearance of the waist.  distal right upper pulmonary artery was then dilated and stent implanted utilizing a pg 1870 bpx genesis stent premounted on 7-mm optiprobe balloon catheter.  repeat angiograms were then performed.  attention was then directed to the large venous collateral vessel arising from the left superior vena cava with a contrast filling of a left-sided azygos vein.  a selective angiogram demonstrated a large azygos vein of the midsection measuring approximately 9.4 mm in diameter.  an amplatzer 12 mm vascular plug was loaded on the delivery catheter and advanced through the flexor sheath into the azygos vein.  once stable device was confirmed, the device was released from the delivery catheter.  the 4-french bernstein catheter was then reintroduced and 5 inch empirical 0.038 inch, 10 cm x 8 mm detachable coils were then implanted above the vascular plug filling the proximal azygos vein.  a pigtail catheter was then introduced into the left superior vena cava for final angiogram.,flows were calculated by the fick technique using an assumed oxygen consumption and contents derived from radiometer hemoximeter saturations and hemoglobin capacity.,cineangiograms were obtained with injection of the coronary sinus of pulmonary veins, the innominate vein, superior vena cava, the main pulmonary artery, and azygos vein.,after angiography, two normal-appearing renal collecting systems were visualized.  the catheters and sheaths were removed and topical pressure applied for hemostasis.  the patient was returned to the recovery room in satisfactory condition.  there were no complications.,discussion:,  oxygen consumption was assumed to be normal mixed venous saturation, but was low due to systemic arterial desaturation of 79%.  the pulmonary veins were fully saturated with partial pressure of oxygen ranging between 120 and 169 mmhg in 30% oxygen.  remaining saturations reflected complete admixture.  there was increased saturation in the left pulmonary artery due to aortopulmonary collateral flow.  phasic right atrial pressures were normal with an a-wave somewhat to the normal right ventricular end-diastolic pressure of 9 mmhg.  left ventricular systolic pressure was systemic with no outflow obstruction to the ascending aorta.  phasic ascending, descending pressures were similar and normal.  mean glenn pressures at initiation of the case were slightly elevated at 14 mmhg with a transpulmonary gradient of 9 mmhg.  the calculated systemic flow was a normal pulmonary flows reduced with a qp:qs ratio of 0.6:1.  the pulmonary vascular resistance was elevated at 4.4 woods units.  following stent implantation in the right caval pulmonary anastomosis and right pulmonary artery, there was a slight increase in the glenn venous pressures to 16 mmhg.  following embolization of the azygos vein, there was increase in systemic arterial saturation to 84% and increase in mixed venous saturation.  there was similar increase in glenn pressures to 28 mmhg with a transpulmonary gradient of 14 mmhg.  there was an increase in arterial pressure.  the calculated systemic flow increased from 3.1 liters /minute/meter squared to 4.3 liters/minute/meter squared.  angiogram within the innominate vein following stent implantation demonstrated appropriate stent position without significant distortion of the innominate vein or proximal cava.  there appeared unobstructed contrast flow to the right lower pulmonary artery of a 1-mmhg mean pressure gradient.  there was absence of contrast filling of the right middle and right upper pulmonary artery.  final angiogram with a contrast injection in the left superior vena cava showed a forward flow through the right glenn, a good contrast filling of the right lower pulmonary artery, and a widely patent left glenn negative contrast washout of the proximal right pulmonary artery and left pulmonary artery presumably due to aortopulmonary collateral flow.  contrast injection within the right upper pulmonary artery following the stent implantation demonstrated widely patent proximal right pulmonary artery along the length of the implanted stents though with retrograde contrast flow.,initial diagnoses:  ,1.  asplenia syndrome.,2.  dextrocardia bilateral superior vena cava.,3.  atrioventricular

PR252,PAT252,2015-02-22,D0C049,"history: , the patient is a 4-month-old who presented with respiratory distress and absent femoral pulses with subsequent evaluation including echocardiogram that demonstrated severe coarctation of the aorta with a peak gradient of 29 mmhg and associated dilated cardiomyopathy with fractional shortening of 16%.  a bicuspid aortic valve was also seen without insufficiency or stenosis.  the patient underwent cardiac catheterization for balloon angioplasty for coarctation of the aorta.,procedure:  ,after sedation and general endotracheal anesthesia, the patient was prepped and draped.  cardiac catheterization was performed as outlined in the attached continuation sheets.  vascular entry was by percutaneous technique, and the patient was heparinized.  monitoring during the procedure included continuous surface ecg, continuous pulse oximetry, and cycled cuff blood pressures, in addition to intravascular pressures.,using a percutaneous technique a 4-french 8 cm long double lumen central venous catheter was inserted in the left femoral vein and sutured into place.  there was good blood return from both the ports.,using a 4-french sheath a 4-french wedge catheter was inserted into the right femoral vein and advanced through the right heart structures out to the branch of pulmonary arteries.  the atrial septum was not probe patent.,using a 4-french sheath a 4-french marker pigtail catheter was inserted into the left femoral artery and advanced retrograde to the descending aorta ,ascending aorta and left ventricle.  a descending aortogram demonstrated discrete coarctation of the aorta approximately 8 mm distal to the origin of the left subclavian artery.  the transverse arch measured 5 mm.  isthmus measured 4.7 mm and coarctation measured 2.9 x 1.8 mm at the descending aorta level.  the diaphragm measured 5.6 mm.  the pigtail catheter was exchanged for a wedge catheter, which was then directed into the right innominate artery.  this catheter was exchanged over a wire for a tyshak mini 6 x 2 cm balloon catheter which was advanced across the coarctation and inflated with complete disappearance of discrete waist.  pressure pull-back following angioplasty, however, demonstrated a residual of 15-20 mmhg gradient.  repeat angiogram showed mild improvement in degree of aortic narrowing.  the angioplasty was then performed using a tyshak mini 7 x 2 cm balloon catheter with complete disappearance of mild waist.  the pigtail catheter was then reintroduced for a pressure pull-back measurement and final angiogram.,flows were calculated by the fick technique using an assumed oxygen consumption.,cineangiograms were obtained with injection in the descending aorta.,after angiography, two normal-appearing renal collecting systems were visualized.  the catheters and sheaths were removed and topical pressure applied for hemostasis.  the patient was returned to the pediatric intensive care unit in satisfactory condition.  there were no complications.,discussion: , oxygen consumption was assumed to be normal.  mixed venous saturation was low due to mild systemic arterial desaturation and anemia.  there is no evidence of significant intracardiac shunt.  further the heart was desaturated due to vq mismatch.,phasic right-sided pressures were normal as was the right pulmonary artery capillary wedge pressure with the a-wave similar to the normal left ventricular end-diastolic pressure of 12 mmhg.  left ventricular systolic pressure was mildly increased with a 60 mmhg systolic gradient into the ascending aorta and a 29 mmhg systolic gradient on pressure pull-back to the descending aorta.  the calculated flows were mildly increased.  vascular resistances were normal.  a cineangiogram with contrast injection in the descending aorta showed a normal left aortic arch with normal origins of the brachiocephalic vessels.  there is discrete juxtaductal coarctation of the aorta.  flow within the intercostal arteries was retrograde.  following balloon angioplasty of coarctation of the aorta, there was slight fall in the mixed venous saturation and an increase in systemic arterial saturation as the fall in left ventricular systolic pressure from 99 mmhg to 92 mmhg.  there remained a 4 mmhg systolic gradient into the ascending aorta and 9 mmhg systolic gradient pressure pull-back to the descending aorta.  the calculated systemic flow fell to normal values.  final angiogram with injection in the descending aorta demonstrated improved caliber of coarctation of the aorta with mild intimal irregularity and a small left lateral filling defect consistent with a small intimal tear in the region of the ductus arteriosus.  there is brisk flow in the descending aorta and appropriate flow in the intercostal arteries.  the narrowest diameter of the aorta measured 4.9 x 4.2 mm.,diagnoses:  ,1.  juxtaductal coarctation of the aorta.,2.  dilated cardiomyopathy.,3.  bicuspid aortic valve.,4.  patent foramen ovale.,intervention: , balloon dilation of coarctation of the aorta.,management: , the case will be discussed at combined cardiology and cardiothoracic surgery case conference.  the patient will be allowed to recover from the current intervention with the hopes of complete left ventricular function recovery.  the patient will undoubtedly require formal coarctation of the aorta repair surgically in 4-6 months.  the further cardiologic care will be directed by dr. x.","cardiovascular / pulmonary, persistent pneumonia, bronchoscopy, brush

experience back pain approximately 2 years ago, which increased.  chest x-ray and ct scan revealed a 3 cm x 4 cm mass abutting the left chest wall inferior to the left scapula with pleural thickening.  a biopsy was performed at an outside hospital (kaiser) and pathology was consistent with mesothelioma.  the patient had a metastatic workup, which was negative including a brain mri and bone scan.  the bone scan showed only signal positivity in the left 9th rib near the tumor.  the patient has a significant past medical history consisting of coronary artery disease, hypertension, non-insulin dependent diabetes, longstanding atrial fibrillation, anemia, and hypercholesterolemia.  he and his family were apprised of the high-risk nature of this surgery preoperatively and informed consent was obtained.,procedure in detail: , the patient was brought to the operating room and placed in the supine position.  the patient was intubated with a double-lumen endotracheal tube.  intravenous antibiotics were given.  a foley catheter was placed.  the patient was placed in the right lateral decubitus position and the left chest was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  an incision approximately 8 inches long was made centered over the mass and extending slightly obliquely over the mass.  the skin and subcutaneous tissues were dissected sharply with the electrocautery.  good hemostasis was obtained.  the tumor was easily palpable and clearly involving the 8th to 9th rib.  a thoracotomy was initially made above the mass in approximately the 7th intercostal space.  inspection of the pleural cavity revealed multiple adhesions, which were taken down with a combination of blunt and sharp dissection.  the thoracotomy was extended anteriorly and posteriorly.  it was clear that in order to obtain an adequate resection of the tumor, approximately 4 rib segment of the chest wall would need to be resected.  the ribs of the chest wall were first cut at their anterior aspect.  the ribs 7, 8, 9, and 10 were serially transected after the interspaces were dissected with electrocautery.  hemostasis was obtained with both electrocautery and clips.  the chest wall segment to be resected was retracted laterally and posteriorly.  it was clear that there were at least 2 areas where the tumor was invading the lung and a lengthy area of diaphragmatic involvement.  inferiorly, the diaphragm was divided to provide a margin of at least 1 to 2 cm around the areas of tumor.  the spleen and the stomach were identified and were protected.  inferiorly, the resection of the chest wall was continued in the 10th interspace.  the dissection was then carried posteriorly to the level of the spine.  the left lung at this point was further dissected out and multiple firings of the gia 75 were used to perform a wedge resection of the left lower lobe, which provided a complete resection of all palpable and visible tumor in the lung.  a 2-0 silk tie was used to ligate the last remaining corner of lung parenchyma at the corner of the wedge resection.  posteriorly, the chest wall segment was noted to have an area at the level of approximately t8 and t9, where the tumor involved the vertebral bodies.  the ribs were disarticulated, closed to or at their articulations with the spine.  bleeding from the intercostal vessels was controlled with a combination of clips and electrocautery.  there was no disease grossly involving or encasing the aorta.,the posterior transection of the ribs was completed and the specimen was passed off of the field as a specimen to pathology for permanent section.  the specimen was oriented for the pathologist who came to the room.  hemostasis was obtained.  the vent in the diaphragm was then closed primarily with a series of figure-of-8 #1 ethibond sutures.  this produced a satisfactory diaphragmatic repair without undue tension.  a single 32-french chest tube was placed in the pleural cavity exiting the left hemithorax anteriorly.  this was secured with a #1 silk suture.  the gore-tex mesh was brought on to the field and was noted to be of adequate size to patch the resulting chest wall defect.  a series of #1 prolene were placed in an interrupted horizontal mattress fashion circumferentially and tied down individually.  the resulting mesh closure was snug and deemed adequate.  the serratus muscle was reapproximated with figure-of-8 0 vicryl.  the latissimus was reapproximated with a two #1 vicryl placed in running fashion.  of note, two #10 jp drains were placed over the mesh repair of the chest wall.  the subcutaneous tissues were closed with a running 3-0 vicryl suture and the skin was closed with a 4-0 monocryl.  the wounds were dressed.  the patient was brought from the operating room

that was found to be inoperable, since it engulfed the porta hepatis. the workup began with gi bleeding. he was seen in my office on 01/11/06 for preop evaluation due to leg edema. a nonocclusive dvt was diagnosed in the proximal left superficial femoral vein. both legs were edematous, and bilateral venous insufficiency was also present. an echocardiogram demonstrated an ejection fraction of 50%. the patient was admitted to the hospital and treated with a greenfield filter since anticoagulant was contraindicated. additional information on the echocardiogram, where a grossly dilated left atrium, moderately severely dilated right atrium. the rhythm was, as stated before, atrial fibrillation with slow atrioventricular conduction and an intraventricular conduction delay on the monitor strip. there was mild to moderate tricuspid regurgitation, mild pulmonic insufficiency. the ejection fraction was considered low normal, since it was estimated 50 to 54%. the patient received blood while in the hospital due to anemia. the leg edema improved while lying down, suggesting that the significant element of venous insufficiency was indeed present. the patient, who was diabetic, received consultation by dr. r. he was also a chronic hypertensive and was treated for that with ace inhibitors. the atrial fibrillation was slow, and no digitalis or beta blockers were recommended at the same time. as a matter of fact, they were discontinued. now, the patient denied any shortness of breath or chest pain throughout this hospitalization, and cardiac nuclear studies performed earlier demonstrated no reversible ischemia.,allergies:, the patient has no known drug allergies.,his diabetes was suspected to be complicated with neuropathy due to tingling in both feet. he received his

and lopressor p.r.n.,assessment and plan:, the patient is a very pleasant elderly gentleman with intractable/inoperable malignancy. his cardiac issues are chronic and most likely secondary to long term hypertension and diabetes. he has chronic atrial fibrillation. i do not envision a scenario whereby he will become a candidate for management of this arrhythmia beyond weight control. he is also not a candidate for anticoagulation, which is, in essence, a part and parcel of the weight control. reason being is high likelihood for gi bleeding, especially given the diagnosis of invasive malignancy with involvement of multiple organs and lymph nodes. at this point, i agree with the notion of hospice care. if his atrioventricular conduction becomes excessive, occasional nondihydropyridine calcium channel blocker such as diltiazem or beta blockers would be appropriate; otherwise, i would keep him off those medications due to evidence of slow conduction in the presence of digitalis and beta blockers.","cardiovascular / pulmonary, coronary artery disease, angina, coronary artery bypass grafting, internal mammary artery, coronary artery, vein graft, artery, bivad,

hyperlipidemia.,medications:,as outpatient,,1.  atenolol 25 mg once a day.,2.  altace 2.5 mg once a day.,3.  zocor 20 mg once a day.,4.  flecainide 200 in the morning and 100 in the evening.,5.  coumadin as directed by our office.,allergies: , to medications are none.  he denies shrimp, sea food or dye allergy.,family history: , he has a nephew who was his sister's son who passed away at age 22 reportedly from an mi, but was reported to have hypertrophic cardiomyopathy as well.  the patient has previously met with the electrophysiologist, dr. x, at general hospital and it sounds like he had a negative ep study.,social history: , the patient does not smoke cigarettes, abuse alcohol nor drink any caffeine.  no use of illicit drugs.  he has been married for 22 years and he is actually accompanied throughout today's cardiology consultation by his wife.  he is not participating in regular exercises now because he states since starting flecainide, he has gotten sluggish.  he is employed as an attorney and while he states that overall his mental stress is better, he has noted more recent mental stress this past weekend when he was taking his daughter back to college.,review of systems: , he denies any history of stroke, cancer, vomiting of blood, coughing up blood, bright red blood per rectum, bleeding stomach ulcers, renal calculi.  there are some questions especially as his wife has told me that he may have obstructive sleep apnea and not had a formal sleep study.,physical exam: , blood pressure 156/93, pulse is 100, respiratory rate 18.  on general exam, he is a pleasant overweight gentleman, in no acute distress.  heent:  shows cranium is normocephalic and atraumatic.  he has moist mucosal membranes.  neck veins are not distended.  there are no carotid bruits.  visible skin warm and perfused.  affect appropriate.  he is quite oriented and pleasant.  no significant kyphoscoliosis on recumbent back exam.  lungs are clear to auscultation anteriorly.

extremities without significant edema.  pulses grossly intact.,diagnostic studies/lab data:,  initial ecg shows atrial flutter.,impression: , mr. a is a 50-year-old gentleman with a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation in the past, more recently is having breakthrough atrial flutter despite flecainide and we had performed a transesophageal echocardiogram-guided cardioversion for him in late 12/20/09, who now has another recurrence within the past 41 hours or so.  i have reviewed again with him in detail regarding risks, benefits, and alternatives of proceeding with cardioversion, which the patient is in favor of.  after in depth explanation of the procedure with him that there would be more definitive resumption of normal sinus rhythm by using electrocardioversion with less long-term side effects, past the acute procedure, alternatives being continued atrial flutter with potential for electrophysiologic consultation for ablation and/or heart rate control with anticoagulation, which the patient was not interested nor was i primarily recommending as the next step, and risks including, but not limited to and the patient was aware and this was all done in the presence of his wife that this is not an all-inclusive list, but the risks include but not limited to oversedation from conscious sedation, risk of aspiration pneumonia from regurgitation of stomach contents, which would be less likely as i did confirm with the patient that he had been n.p.o. for greater than 15 hours, risk of induction of other arrhythmias including tachyarrhythmias requiring further management including cardioversion or risk of bradyarrhythmias, in the past when we had a cardioverter with 150 joules, he did have a 5.5-second pause especially while he is on antiarrhythmic therapy, statistically less significant risk of cva, although we cannot really make that null.  the patient expressed understanding of this risk, benefit, and alternative analysis.  i invited questions from him and his wife and once their questions were answered to their self-stated satisfaction, we planned to go forward with the procedure.,procedure note:  ,the patient received a total of 7 mg of versed and 50 micrograms of fentanyl utilizing titrate-down sedation with good effect and this was after the appropriate time-out procedure had been done as per the medical center universal protocol with appropriate identification of the patient, position, procedure documentation, procedure indication, and there were no questions.  the patient did actively participate in this time-out procedure.  after the universal protocol was done, he then received the cardioversion attempt with 50 joules using ""lollipop posterior patch"" with hands-driven paddle on the side, which was 50 joules of synchronized biphasic energy.  there was successful resumption of normal sinus rhythm, in fact this time there was not a significant pause as compared to when he had this done previously in late 12/09 and this sinus rhythm was confirmed by a 12-lead ekg.,impression: , cardioversion shows successful resumption of normal sinus rhythm from atrial flutter and that is while the patient has been maintained on coumadin and his inr is 3.22.  we are going to watch him and discharge him from the medical center area on his current flecainide of 200 mg in the morning and 100 mg in the evening, atenolol 25 mg once a day, coumadin _____ as currently being diagnosed.  i had previously discussed with the patient and he was agreeable with meeting with his electrophysiologist again, dr. x, at electrophysiology unit at general hospital and i will be planning to place a call for dr. x myself.  again, he has no ischemia on this most recent stress test and i suppose in the future it may be reasonable to get obstructive sleep apnea evaluation and that may be one issue promulgating his symptoms.,i had previously discussed the case with dr. y who is the patient's general cardiologist as well as updated his wife at the patient's bedside regarding our findings.","cardiovascular / pulmonary, main stem bronchus, bronchoscopy, airway, foreign body removal, rigid bronchoscopy,"

aortocoronary bypass surgery about eight years ago at halifax medical center where she had triple vessel bypass surgery with left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending artery, saphenous vein graft to the left circumflex and right coronary arteries.  since then, she has generally done well.  she used to be seeing another cardiologist and apparently she had a stress test in september 2008 and she was otherwise cardiac catheterization and coronary angiography, but the patient declined to have one done and since then she has been on medical therapy.,the patient had been on medical therapy at home and generally doing well.  recently, she had no leg swelling, undue exertional dyspnea, orthopnea, or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.  she denies any rest or exertional chest discomfort.  yesterday evening, she had her dinner and she was sitting around and she felt discomfort in the chest at about 7:00 p.m.  the discomfort was a crampy pain in the left lower quadrant area, which seemed to radiating to the center of the abdomen and to the right side and it was off and on lasting for a few minutes at a time and then subsiding.  later on she was nauseous, but she did not have any vomiting.  she denied any diarrhea.  no history of fever or chills.  since the pain seemed to persist, the patient came to the hospital emergency room at 11:35 p.m. where she was seen and admitted for the same.  she was given morphine, zofran, demerol, another zofran, and reglan as well as demerol again and she was given intravenous fluids.  subsequently, her pain finally went away and she does not have any pain since about 7:00 a.m. this morning.  the patient was admitted however for further workup and treatment.  at the time of my examination this afternoon, the patient is sitting, lying in bed and comfortable and has no abdominal pain of any kind.  she has not been fed any food, however.  the patient also had had pelvis and abdominal ct scan performed, which has been described to be partial small bowel obstruction, internal hernia, volvulus or adhesion most likely in the left flank area.  the patient has had left nephrectomy and splenectomy, which has been
